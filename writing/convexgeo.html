    <h1>Convex Geometry for Computers</h1>

    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center;">8/13/2023</p>
    <br>

    <p> Today we will be covering how to convey (high-dimensional and non-convex) geometry to computers. Specifically, we will
        be discussing how computers can efficiently represent shapes, how they can quickly optimize functions over such
        shapes, and how to bound this optimization for approximation and verification. Along the way, we'll see how
        convexity is such an important and beautiful condition, allowing for strong approximations to
        problems that are otherwise impossible. This intro is best suited for somebody who knows what convexity means,
        though we briefly introduce these concepts for the uninitiated.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: left">What is Convexity?</h3>

    <p>We define a convex combination of two points \(a\) and \(b\) as \(\lambda a + (1-\lambda)b\) for any \(\lambda
        \in [0, 1]\). This is best visualized as any point along the line between \(a\) and \(b\), and there is a
        natural extension to more points as a linear combination with non-negative coefficients that sum to \(1\). </p>

    <br>

    <p>We can visualize a convex function \(f\) as a "bowl facing upward". More concretely, for any two points \(a, b\)
        in the domain of \(f\), we have the "convex combination of the outputs is greater than the output of the convex
        combination of the inputs", or</p>
        
    <p style="overflow-x: scroll;">\[\forall a, b, \lambda \in [0, 1], f(\lambda a + (1-\lambda)b) \geq f(\lambda a)
        + f((1-\lambda)b).\]</p>

    <p>A convex set \(S\) is a shape such that it contains every convex combination of any two points \(a, b \in S\), or </p>
    
    <p style="overflow-x: scroll;">\[\forall \lambda \in [0, 1], \forall a \in S, \forall b \in S, \lambda a + (1-\lambda) b \in S .\]</p>
    
    <p>The extreme
        points of a set are points in the set that can not be expressed as a convex combination of other points in the
        set. For a polygon, this would be the vertices. </p>

            the right, we picture a convex set containing all of it's convex combinations. </figcaption>
        </p>
    </figure>

    <h3 style="text-align: left">Representing Convex Sets</h3>

    <h4 style="text-align: left">Defining the Convex Hull</h4>

    <p>Representing sets in general is impossible (we can't even represent every real number on a computer!), but convex
        sets generally have some nice structure which makes them easier to represent. We start by defining a really cool
        operator called the convex hull.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The <b>Convex Hull</b> of a set \(S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d\), written as \(\text{Conv}(S)\), has the following
        equivalent definitions.
    <ol>
        <li>The set of all convex combinations of subsets of \(S\)</li>
        <li>The smallest convex set containing \(S\)</li>
        <li>The set of all convex combinations of the extreme points of \(S\)</li>
        <li>The intersection of all half-spaces that contain \(S\)</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        From these, you can pick your favorite definition to show that \(S\) is convex iff \(\text{Conv}(S) = S\).
        Importantly, definitions 3 and 4 give us nice ways to represent convex sets
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>V-representation</b>, which constitutes the extreme points of the set</li>
        <li>The <b>H-representation</b>, which constitutes the half-spaces that contain the set</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align: left">Geometric Duality</h4>
    <p>For different sets, we care about using different representations of our set. For some fundamental examples,
        let's consider \(\ell_p\) balls in dimension \(d\) (defined by \(\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d: ||x||_p \leq 1\}\)).
    <figure>
        <img src="../images/convexgeo/ellpballs_3.png" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;">
        <p>
        <figcaption>Figure 2: Visualization of \(\ell_p\) balls </figcaption>
        </p>
    </figure>
    <ul>
        <li>The \(\ell_1\) ball has \(2d\) extreme points and is contained by \(2^d\) half-spaces.</li>
        <li>The \(\ell_{\infty}\) ball has \(2^d\) extreme points and is contained by \(2d\) half-spaces.</li>
        <li>The \(\ell_2\) ball has infinite extreme points and infinite half-spaces that contain it, so we should not
            use the V or H representations.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        From the above, it seems like we would want to use the V-representation for \(p=1\),
        the H-representation for \(p=\infty\), and neither for \(p=2\). We also run into a cute "flip" between
        what's needed for \(p=1\) and \(p=\infty\). Is it just a coincidence? Actually, it's an instantiation of a more
        general Duality Transform, which takes a shape and inverts it over the unit sphere. Specifically, given a set
        \(S\), construct the set \(S^* = \{q : \langle q, p \rangle \leq 1, \forall p \in S\}\). By
        convexity, this is equivalent to \(\{q : \langle q, p \rangle \leq 1, \forall p \in \text{ExtPts}(S)\}\).
        Note that this corresponds exactly to an intersection of half-spaces, specifically \(|\text{ExtPts}(S)|\)
        of them. Moreover, through expanding the definitions we can see that the dual of the dual is the original shape,
        or that \(S^{**} = S\).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        We observe that the \(\ell_1\) ball and the \(\ell_{\infty}\) ball are duals of each other. This explains why
        their vertex and half-space counts are flippedâ€”it's because the duality transform swaps each extreme point for
        a half-space and each half-space for an extreme point! Also since the \(\ell_2\) ball is its own's dual, this is
        why it has the same number of faces and vertices.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: left">Convex Functions
        over Convex Sets</h3>

    <p>Many of the important problems in computer science can be phrased under optimization, or finding the best valid
        point with respect to an objective function. In it's most general instantiation, we write it in the format of a
        "Mathematical Program" as follows.</p>
    <p style="overflow-x: scroll;">$$\begin{aligned}
        &\text{maximize} && f(x) \\
        &\text{subject to} && x \in S
        \end{aligned}$$</p>
    <p>With the tools from the previous section, we can rewrite \(x \in S\) as a set of inequalities represented by
        \(g(x) \leq 0\). For simplicity, I am omitting many simple generalizations such as expressing equalities via
        inequalities, expressing minimization as the negation of maximization, multiple inequalities, etc. For a general
        choice of objective function \(f\) and constraint set \(S\), this problem is
        intractable since
        optimization is generally very difficult. However, for some well-behaved choices, this problem becomes feasible
        and often very efficient. The art comes in formulating the \(f\) and \(S\) of interest for the domain,
        representing it a computer-friendly manner, and then writing or using the correct algorithm to solve your
        specific program. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Let's start by assuming that both \(f\) and \(S\) are convex. We know that for a convex set, every point can be
        expressed as a convex combination of the extreme points. Therefore, by the convexity of \(f\), we know that any
        maximum to the objective function must lie at one of the extreme points. Therefore, if the function has very few
        extreme points, then our task is really easy.</p>
    <!-- <br>
    <p>If the world was convex, our job would be done here. However, the world is really complicated and not everything
        is as nice as a convex function over a convex set. Thankfully, many complicated phenomena can be
        well-approximated by convex analogues. Let's start by considering the convex relaxation of a program. </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>TODO: CONVEX RELAXTION INTRO</b> Many interesting problems are more complicated. To this end, we introduce
        convex
        relaxation. For all of our constraints, we take the convex hull of the epigraph.

        Example: max matching
        max sum Aij for Aij = 0 when no edge between ij, Aij in {0,1} when edge between ij, and sum_i Aij <= 1 Can
            express this constraint as |Aij - 0.5| <=0.5 and |Aij - 0.5|>= 0.5
            convex relaxation allows you to take Aij doubly stochastic instead of permutation matrices.

            There's an algorithm to take relaxation to optimal integral solution</p> -->


    <h3 style="text-align: left">Bounding Convex Functions over Convex Sets</h3>

    <p>Finding the precise answer to an optimization problem is really difficult. In many cases, we are actually more
        interested in bounding the optimization problem, giving some lower or upper bounds. For a minimization problem,
        the value at any feasible point serves as an upper bound, since the minimum of the objective function can not be
        greater than the value at all of the feasible points. In practice, when the set is well-behaved, one can
        efficiently get bounds by doing Projected Gradient Descent, or using gradient descent while staying inside the
        constraint set to find tighter upper bounds. In fact, for convex problems, this technique is guaranteed to
        converge.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lower bounding a minimization problem is much more complicated since its hard to say something that's
        simultaneously true for all of the points in the constraint set. However, its often this property that makes
        lower bounds so usefulâ€”of the objective function says something about safety or violating a property, a
        lower-bound can certify that all points are safe. </p>

    <h4 style="text-align: left">Lagrange Duality</h4>
    <p>To efficiently provide tight lower bounds, we introduce the technique of <b>Lagrange duality</b>. Let's start by
        considering the program which we want to lower bound. </p>

    <p style="overflow-x: scroll;">$$\begin{aligned}
        &\min_x && f(x) \\
        &\text{s.t.} && g(x) \leq 0
        \end{aligned}$$</p>

    <p>The current problem is that we don't know where \(g(x) \leq 0\) so we try to remove this constraint by folding it
        into the optimization problem. We can do this introducing a Lagrange multiplier \(\lambda\), as shown in the
        following program.</p>

    <p style="overflow-x: scroll;">$$\begin{aligned}
        &\min_x \; \max_{\lambda\geq 0} \; f(x) + \lambda g(x)
        \end{aligned}$$</p>

    <p>In this new program, it seems like there are no constraints, so it might be surprising that its equivalent to our
        original program. However, let's consider this min max formulation as a two player game, where the outer player
        (who we'll name Minnie) selects a value of \(x\) and the inner player (who we'll name Maxie) then selects a
        value of \(\lambda\) based on this choice. If Maxie selects an \(x\) such that \(g(x) > 0\), then Minnie will
        select a \(\lambda\) arbitrarily large and drive the entire optimization problem to \(\infty\). This is at odds
        with Minnie's goal of minimizing the objective value, so Minnie will only select values of \(x\) such that
        \(g(x) \leq 0\). Interestingly, this renders Maxie's best strategy to always set \(\lambda = 0\) since any other
        value can only hurt Maxie and help Minnie. Therefore, the two programs are equivalent!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Even though these problems are equivalent, the new problem is not any easier to solve. For our next trick, we
        observe that we can switch Minnie and Maxie to lower bound the value of the problem above by the problem below!
    </p>

    <p>$$\begin{align}
        &\max_{\lambda\geq 0} \; \min_x \; f(x) + \lambda g(x)
        \end{align}$$</p>

    <p>This is a direct consequence of the minimax theorem, which is briefly proven below.</p>

    <p style="overflow-x: scroll;">\[\begin{aligned}
        h(x', y') &\geq \min_{x} h(x, y') && \text{(true for all \(x', y', h\) by definition of min)} \\
        \max_{y} h(x', y) &\geq \min_{x} h(x, y') && \text{(true for all \(x', y', h\) by definition of max)} \\
        \max_{y} h(x', y) &\geq \max_{y} \min_{x} h(x, y) && \text{(true for all \(x', h\) by picking the best y')} \\
        \min_{x} \max_{y} h(x, y) &\geq \max_{y} \min_{x} h(x, y) && \text{(true for all \(h\) by picking the best x')}
        \\
        \end{aligned}\]
    </p>

    <p>We consider this problem the <b>dual</b> of the original problem, which we refer to as the <b>primal</b>. By our
        inequalities above, we've proven that the dual of a minimization problem always serves as a lower bound to the
        primal. Before we dive into the beauty of duality, let's work through a simple example. </p>

    <p style="overflow-x: scroll;">$$\begin{aligned}
        &\left[\min_x x_1^2 + 2x_2^2 \;\text{ s.t. }\; x_1 + x_2 \geq 1\right] \\
        &\geq \left[\max_{\lambda \geq 0} \min_x x_1^2 + 2x_2^2 - \lambda x_1 - \lambda x_2 + \lambda \right] &&
        \text{(Lagrange duality)} \\
        &= \left[\max_{\lambda \geq 0} -\frac38 \lambda^2 + \lambda \right] && \text{(min solved by \(x_1 =
        \frac{\lambda}{2}, x_2 = \frac{\lambda}{4}\))}\\
        &= \frac{2}{3} && \text{(\(\lambda = \frac{4}{3}, x_1 = \frac{2}{3}, x_2 = \frac{1}{3}\))}\\
        \end{aligned}$$</p>

    <p>The above shows that the original quadratic program is lower bounded by \(\frac{2}{3}\). But before we discuss
        that, let's look at some of the
        beautiful properties of the process of Lagrange duality.</p>

    <ol>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Dual is always convex:</b> Note that the inner problem is a minimum of functions linear in \(\lambda\)
            for every choice of \(x\). Since a minimum of linear functions is always concave, the outer objective is
            always concave in \(\lambda\). Since optimizing a concave problem under convex constraints \(\lambda \geq
            0\) is a convex problem, the dual is always convex regardless of how gnarly the original problem is.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Closed form in \(x\):</b> Frequently, after the swap of Maxie and Minnie, the inner minimization problem
            will have a closed form in \(x\) due to the lack of constraints. This allows us humans to aid the computer
            by deriving the optimal solution and removing the inner minimization problem.</li>
        <li><b>Lower bound for all \(\lambda\):</b> By definition of max, our lower bound holds for any choice of
            \(\lambda\). Therefore, even if we do not find the \(\lambda\) which solves the outer optimization problem,
            our choice can give a sound lower bound, and we can now apply heuristic techniques like Projected Gradient
            Descent on \(\lambda\) to get sound lower bounds for safety!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These properties make Lagrange duality an excellent computational tool to lower bound optimization problems!
        However, one natural concern is how tight these bounds are; it would be a little too magical for us to get tight
        lower bounds for every problem. A sharp eye would observe that for the earlier quadratic program, the solution
        to the dual is the solution to the primal! When the dual and the primal have no "gap", we have <b>Strong
            Duality</b>. When there is a gap, we say that we have <b>Weak Duality</b>. For example, all linear programs
        (linear objective and constraints) meet strong duality. Through visualizing convex duality (which I'll add here
        another day :)), we can get a sense for why strong duality holds for all convex problems and why the dual of a
        convex relaxation is the convex relaxation of the dual. </p>

    <br>

    <p>I hope you enjoyed the introduction to how computers represent shapes and optimize functions as well as why
        convexity is such a fundamental aspect of computational geometry. Please reach out if there are any questions or
        errors! </p>
